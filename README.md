# Final Assignment

My final JS project is the first coded prototype of a project called Beyond Today. Beyond today is a branching narrative that guide the user through a series of decisions about Reproductive rights in the future. 

#### : Approach
I used two JS libraries to create this prototype. The first being impress, a presentation framework. I customized the library to allow the user to go backwards through the narrative as well as the ability to select a different path. The second library that I used is called geometryangle. This library is used to create the moving geometric background. I adjsuted the library to achieve the colour, speed, light and shading effects that I was aiming for.
